Orage
=====

Orage is a "big metal" Lightning node with a focus on high-availability, modularity and security.

Orage is not an attempt to create a new Lightning Network stack. Instead, it is a concerted effort to 
simplify the onboarding experience for users who are new to Bitcoin and Lightning. The project is built on 
the Lightning Development Kit (LDK) and aims to provide the necessary tools, simplicity, and infrastructure 
to ease the integration of both individual users and enterprises into the ecosystem.

Orage, being constructed on the LDK, will offer in-built features such as custom scripts. These scripts will 
provide greater flexibility in the types of applications that can be built on the Lightning Network. The ultimate 
goal is to encourage the development of more 'Lightning-aware' applications. The integration of custom scripts, 
escrow, Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs), and Taproot will collectively facilitate this ambition.

Goals

- LSP tool chain specification
- Splicing and duel funded channels
